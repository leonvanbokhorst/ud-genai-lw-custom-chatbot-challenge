"HOPE, LEF AND PRIDE - Main Line Agreement 2024 - 2028 by PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB The Netherlands is a beautiful country. A country to be proud of."
We have to work hard to earn the trust of the Dutch.
Every day.
Because trust cannot be taken for granted.
"Politics and administration, despite good intentions, have failed in recent years, by not always taking people's concerns seriously."
We are breaking new ground.
"With a program cabinet in which PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB offer people grip and support. A cabinet that shows courage and radiates pride. A cabinet that gives hope."
"Whether it is livelihood security, care or money in the wallet, or the availability of sufficient housing, our ambition is great."
We also want to reverse the far too high influx of asylum seekers and immigrants.
"We want farmers, gardeners and fishermen to have a future again."
We see a government that is a beacon of reliability for all Dutch people. People who deserve legal security and good governance.
With safety for their families in their own neighborhoods.
"That is why PVV, VVD, NSC and BBB are taking these concrete steps in this agreement: - Tax relief from 2025, aimed at the hard-working Dutch, young and old, such as middle-income, entrepreneurs."
And also for people in a pinch and their livelihoods.
- The strictest asylum admission regime and the most comprehensive migration control package ever.
"- A big push in housing, infrastructure, accessibility and energy transition."
- More than halving the health care deductible to the level of 165 euros by 2027 and investing in elderly care.
- Ownership in agriculture and fisheries; a boost for a future of these sectors and for food security for all of us.
- More control of citizens through a different electoral system and strengthening of fundamental rights through a constitutional court. - Keeping the Dutch safe by taking a firm approach to crime and terror.
"We live in times of great tension, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The global economy is under pressure."
"There are new and serious threats to the security of our society and the stability of the democratic rule of law from various state and non-state actors. Page | 1 These threats are not only remote, but they are increasing and rapidly approaching. This now requires timely adequate preparations, alertness and strengthening resilience in a broad sense, including from citizens and businesses."
"The new cabinet will work on a coalition program based on this outline agreement with the following 10 main points: 1. Livelihood security and purchasing power 2. Getting a grip on asylum and migration 3. Housing and public housing, infrastructure, public transportation and aviation; every region counts 4. A good future for agriculture and fisheries, for food security, for nature 5. Energy, security of supply and climate adaptation 6. Accessible public facilities; care and education 7. Good governance and strong rule of law 8. National security 9. International security 10. Solid public finances, economy and business climate Safeguarding the democratic rule of law and stable public finances are indispensable preconditions."
The cabinet is incorporating this outline agreement into a coalition program.
1. Livelihood security and purchasing power The Netherlands is one of the most prosperous countries in the world.
"Our economy has emerged stronger from the crises and there have never been so many jobs. Our strong economy runs on all Dutch people who work or undertake hard every day, contributing to our prosperity. Yet many Dutch people have actually become anxious about their future. They are uncertain about their daily existence and livelihood, as well as about the cost of basic necessities (food, housing, energy) and its security in the medium term. It is about the level of income, to income security but also to the accessibility and availability of housing (for example, for first-time buyers), care and education. These concerns live not only among people with lower income, but also among middle-income earners."
"In addition, income support schemes from the national and municipal governments, such as benefits, are too complicated or work against each other."
"Especially for people who are vulnerable, this whole thing is difficult to fathom."
"What is needed now are measures that people notice directly in their wallets, giving them more pay for work. Measures that focus on security and participation in the labor market, that do not further level the playing field and at the same time prevent (child) poverty in the Netherlands. Therefore, the new cabinet aims to ensure that (child) poverty rates do not exceed the reference year 2024. In addition, measures are needed that mean that working more also means that people get ahead, with a specific focus on middle-income workers. Page | 2 Measures for housing, education and entrepreneurship are discussed later. For income, purchasing power and health care, these are: - More pay for work by reducing the burden on labor and lowering the marginal pressure for citizens, for example through the introduction of an additional bracket in the Income Tax."
"- A bottleneck approach for specific groups below the subsistence level, including the working poor."
"- More than halving the health care deductible to the level of 165 euros by 2027. - Security in the labor market is promoted, for example, for genuine self-employed workers (zzp'ers) in the self-employment policy and through regulation of the temporary employment sector."
"In addition we strive for more permanent contracts for employees. To this end, the legislative debate on the Law Clarifying Assessment of Labor Relations and Legal Presumption (VBAR) and the Law Admitting the Posting of Workers (WTTA) continues."
"- The improvement of (municipal) debt assistance will continue, with a focus on addressing the problems at the source. - The child care system overhaul (almost free for working parents and transfer to institutions) will continue."
"- Step-by-step improvements in social security, tax schemes and benefits are being made so that work pays more. Legislation is being prepared to reform the benefits and tax system."
"2. Getting a grip on asylum and migration The Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe with sharply increased and persistently rising (asylum, labor, knowledge, study and family) migration, which weighs hard on housing, care, education and financial resources, and on social cohesion in our country. Limiting the scale of and controlling all types of migration to the Netherlands, as soon as possible, is necessary, for now and for the longer term. Concrete steps are being taken toward the strictest admission regime for asylum and the most comprehensive package for controlling migration ever. The entire asylum and migration system will be reformed, the influx targeted and maximally reduced with a broad package of measures so as to provide a solution to the current acute situation, with room for those who are really allowed to stay here and maintain support."
"First, the exemption provision of the Aliens Act 2000 (pursuant to Sections 110 and 111) will be activated as soon as possible. In the general order in council required for this purpose, supporting reasons, those provisions of the Aliens Act 2000 that stand in the way of directly addressing the acute emergency situation, for the asylum influx in general and the asylum reception in Ter Apel and the other asylum centers in particular, will be rendered inoperative, or those provisions will be replaced with a view to achieving this goal. Second, there will immediately be a temporary Asylum Crisis Act with crisis measures to address acute asylum influx and reception crisis for the coming period, including by repealing the Spreading Act."
"Pursuant to this Asylum Crisis Act, the powers contained therein will be deployed to provide for the duration of up to two years: Page | 3 - Enforce registration and suspend processing of asylum applications (""asylum decision freeze""), the right to reception will be restricted differentially during the suspension and will be severely curtailed."
"- Deport people without a valid residence permit as much as possible, including by force. - To deviate from the Housing Act by prohibiting giving priority in the allocation of social housing to status holders on the basis that they are status holders."
"In this Asylum Crisis Act, where possible, first steps for structural measures are already taken, such as strengthening of border controls and surveillance, including tightening mobile surveillance security (mtv), partly in relation to border control on the basis of the Schengen Border Code. The national asylum chain will be strengthened by bringing it under the unambiguous direction of the prime minister."
"Third, an opt-out clause for European asylum and migration policy will be submitted to the European Commission as soon as possible."
"With like-minded and surrounding countries, the cooperated intensively in order to act appropriately in times of a joint crisis due to influx (""mini- Schengen""), in addition to structurally intensifying mobile surveillance security."
"Fourth, in order to limit the asylum influx, the Netherlands must structurally belong to the category of member states with the strictest admission rules in Europe. Therefore: - Tighten admission procedure (adjust burden of proof, no reward for deliberate failure to prove identity, adjust and enforce safe country criteria and enforce Dublin Regulation, read cell phones, limit legal aid)."
"- Structural intensification in mobile surveillance security, border control and border surveillance."
"Irregular migrants found at these land border controls were immediately sent back to Germany and Belgium, including for lack of valid ID."
- The country policy is being substantially adjusted.
"The Netherlands is currently too attractive for asylum seekers; the acceptance rates must go from above to below the European average, including through burden of proof reversal, so that it is not up to the IND to prove that someone has no right to stay here."
"- Introduction of two-state system including inflow-reducing restrictions, including: o no automatic family reunification of subsidiary protected persons, and o hefty restriction on post-travelers, including restriction to the so-called nuclear family with children up to age 18 and longer time frames before such is possible at all."
"- There will be appeals to one court for asylum without an appeal. - Indefinite asylum permit will be abolished, those for temporary residence modified. - Reception of underprivileged asylum seekers at separate locations with a regime that is as austere as possible and partially closed; the state contribution to the National Immigration Facility is terminated. - Legal aid for asylum applications will be reduced as much as possible and maximally scaled down for repeated asylum applications."
"Page | 4 - Procedures are shortened and made more austere, for example by shortening the appeal period and limiting the possibility of repeat applications. Periodic penalty payments for failure to meet deadlines are abolished or limited."
- Tougher action against nuisances.
"- Tackling crime among and from asylum seekers hard, including by: dealing directly with offenders, including through removal from the reception facility, earlier halting the asylum procedure and the earlier revocation of residence permits, by expanding the declaration of undesirability and by further tightening the ""sliding scale"" so that criminal aliens can be deported more quickly. Strict and strict action will be taken in registration and reception locations against violence and nuisance by asylum seekers, especially towards female asylum seekers and asylum seekers from LGBTQ+ and/or Christian backgrounds. - Failure to cooperate in deportation after final rejection or loss of a residence permit becomes a criminal offense."
"- The commitment to return will be tightened by, among other things, deportation of asylum seekers previously rejected in another EU member state, expansion of immigration detention and detention and of the pronouncement of undesirability, and limitation of municipal reception (funding) to the most basic."
The safe country concept is broadened to include safe parts of countries based on official reports; official reports are in principle not made public.
"- The EU migration pact with tightened asylum rules and admission procedures, once adopted, will be implemented as soon as possible, including by opting for buyout rather than reception when redistributing asylum seekers. - At the same time, the Netherlands is pushing for further tightening of EU regulations, including screening of disadvantaged asylum seekers and working toward strict procedures at the EU's external borders and agreements on return with third countries. The Netherlands is working with other EU member states on receiving in non-EU countries migrants who enter the EU trying to achieve. - Human trafficking, human smuggling and all illegal immigration routes are addressed, nationally and Europe-wide."
- Own contribution to reception by displaced persons from Ukraine is increased. - Maximum commitment to reception in the region and migration deals to that end. - A modernization of the UN Refugee Convention will be advocated by the background of the above and cooperation with like-minded member states herein is sought to achieve this at the UN. Efforts are being made to adapt EU regulations and treaties where necessary.
"Fifth, measures are being taken to control volume and composition of other migration. There is a great need to get a grip on labor migration. Labor migration is necessary for our economy and entrepreneurs, but it is necessary to remain critical about who we need and who needs us. There will be a consideration framework for the establishment of new businesses, in relation to the labor migrants, space and energy needed. Measures are being taken to limit labor migration at low wages and under poor working conditions: Page | 5 - The recommendations of the Aanjaagteam bescherming arbeidsmigranten (""Roemer Report"") are being implemented."
- Malafide employment agencies are being cracked down on.
"The temporary employment industry and recruitment agencies are regulated by an authorization system (WTTA). - Migrant workers from outside the EU, with the exception of knowledge migrants, will be work permit requirement."
"The Netherlands Labor Inspectorate (NLA) is going to enforce extra, also on this group. - Employers of labor migrants (non-Dutch residents) become responsible for nuisance and costs of labor migrants without regular housing (shortstay and midstay)."
They must therefore make agreements with municipalities in which their employees short- and midstay are housed. Encourage co-governments to allow more room for housing on the employer's own property.
"- With long-term residence, employers are also given a responsibility for these workers to learn the Dutch language."
"- Consider whether and, if so, which tax benefits under the extraterritorial cost (ETK) scheme will be scaled back."
"- With regard to labor migration, the Netherlands is committed to restricting the free movement of persons within the EU if and to the extent that EU enlargement is raised. Knowledge and study migration is important for the Dutch economy, but the scale must be proportional to what municipalities, education, care and housing can bear. Therefore: - The qualification requirements of the knowledge migrant scheme are being tightened and increased. - Restrict study migration in higher education at the undergraduate stage, except for studies where there are labor market shortages, taking into account local conditions (the greater the problems, the more restrictions). - Study migration becomes more selective through more courses in Dutch, a numerus fixus for foreign students, restriction to obtaining a basic scholarship and increase in tuition fees for non-EU students."
- The Netherlands should not be naive about state actors sending people here or directing them here for espionage.
Measures are being taken to protect our knowledge.
An additional and mandatory commitment to civic integration and integration.
The premise is that you are one of us if you participate and subscribe to Dutch values.
- Integration includes knowledge about the Holocaust and its victims.
"- The standard term for naturalization will be extended to 10 years, regardless of residence fixed or indefinite."
- Foreigners who wish to adopt our nationality renounce their other nationality wherever possible. - The language requirement for naturalization is raised in principle to B1 for everyone.
"- Address foreign undue influence, such as through weekend schools."
- There will be regulation of amplified prayer calls.
Page | 6 - Harmful practices such as marital coercion and female genital mutilation are addressed.
"3. Housing and public housing, infrastructure, public transportation and aviation; every region counts 3.1 Addressing housing crisis Public housing is a constitutional duty of government: the historic housing shortage seriously hinders the livelihood security of young people in particular. Reducing this is a top priority."
"Achieving sufficient housing is under pressure due to the double aging population, smaller households on average, migration, tightness in the labor market, rising construction and land prices, interest rate developments, complicated and lengthy construction procedures, lack of and inefficient use of available space, and tax regulations that are counterproductive."
"No additional, national sustainability regulations for building will be imposed."
"There will be a coordinating minister who will direct land use planning and where to build how many homes. This will include housing for focus groups (young people, the elderly, smaller households, the homeless). A Housing Summit will be organized as soon as possible, in which central government, pension funds, housing corporations, social partners, municipalities and provinces will make enforceable agreements to structurally increase housing construction. As a political goal, the agreement is to structurally build an additional 100,000 housing units per year, suitable for the demographic and spatial developments in the coming years. In addition, a breakthrough must be forced through the following measures: - It is promoted that housing corporations can also play a greater role in the (low) middle rental sector, by working in the EU to change the relevant rules."
"- The existing housing stock will be better utilized by expanding the rezoning of existing buildings and putting them on a legal footing where desirable (rezoning office and commercial properties, opting out and/or splitting up homes, ""family living,"" home sharing, tolerating recreational homes to be permanently occupied). - Construction of new housing is accelerated by the following measures: o Ensuring that more land is available (""alleyway,"" inner-city and outer-city); in newly zoned areas, housing development, in the case of competition for land, over windmills. There will be future-proof construction and consideration of water, soil, landscape and urban planning quality. o Supplementing existing housing sites and (ongoing) housing deals by identifying new areas for large-scale housing development, preferably around existing infrastructure."
"There will be a proposal to this effect as soon as possible, based in part on the NOVEX program."
"o More available and affordable building land, lower costs and greater autonomy for co-governments through a tax on unbuilt land with a residential function. The possibilities for a capped plan income tax or similar system in housing development will be exploited. It is agreed with municipalities that the revenues Page | 7 of this entirely in favor of neighborhood accessibility and building affordable rental and owner-occupied housing. o Speeding up procedures: limiting appeals (line bill Regie op de volkshuisvesting), supplemented by elimination of other stumbling blocks (availability of locations, land and financial and fiscal incentives, limiting rules that unnecessarily hinder building in the outlying area, for example on one's own property, addressing bottlenecks around capacity and knowledge)."
"In addition to sounding board groups for local residents, sounding board groups for house seekers will also be established."
"o Removing legal and financial barriers to a new third sector: cooperative living. - Affordable: o At least 30% of new construction must be average - that is, with area-specific differentiation - social rent; the bill Strengthening Public Housing Control will be amended to give municipalities more local room here. Two thirds of the new housing to be built must be affordable for middle-income households. o The rental policies of social landlords will need to continue to strengthen affordability while enabling necessary investments in new construction, sustainability and livable neighborhoods. o The annual social rent development follows the existing agreement with the housing corporations until 2026, namely the CLA development -0.5%."
"As of 2026, the consumer price index (cpi) +0% will be followed."
"With a resistant rent subsidy, this will maintain subsistence levels for tenants with the lowest incomes. o Measures are being taken to make private renting, middle renting and free renting more attractive. o Building (private) rental housing is stimulated by reducing the regulatory burden and, where possible, the tax burden. The housing impulse is partially used for this purpose."
"o There will be binding agreements with housing corporations, including on middle rent. - Properties for sale: o No change to the tax status of owner-occupied housing, to combat uncertainty in the housing market. o The increase in municipal housing tax (OZB) is capped through agreements with municipalities. o In (local) programming of owner-occupied housing, take into account sufficient housing for the elderly, to promote flow. o It is investigated whether and under what strict conditions the right of tenants of social housing (not being skewed tenants) to buy their rental property can be given shape (social purchase)."
o The mortgage interest deduction will not be questioned; the home equity rate will remain unchanged.
"3.2 Infrastructure, Public transportation and aviation For housing, infrastructure and accessibility, the area-based approach is paramount; every region counts. Action is needed to maintain and further improve accessibility throughout the Netherlands, also in the long term."
"Page | 8 - There is a major maintenance challenge in the coming years. The goal is to maintain the minimum required basic quality of existing road, waterway and public transit infrastructure."
"- In addition - if there are sufficient personnel, permit space and resources - the 17 paused projects will be taken up (e.g."
"A1/A30 (Barneveld Oost), A67 (Leenderheide - Geldrop), Volkerak and Kreekrak locks, IJsselmeer - Meppel waterway). Priority bottlenecks in public transport and on water are the Lower Saxony line (Groningen - Almelo/Enschede), the OV- Amsterdam-Haarlemmermeer connection and the navigability of the IJssel River. - For rail connections, what is needed is considered per region, not just focusing on the major cities. In border regions, good rail connections with neighboring countries are essential."
"- More sustainable vehicle fleets will continue to be encouraged. Electric drivers are going to contribute fairly, to keep the revenues sustainable in the long run."
- The speed limit on the highway will be increased to 130 kilometers per hour - where possible.
"- Construction of the Lely Line will be continued, with construction starting in Groningen if implementation is technically possible."
International rail transport will be promoted by removing barriers for new entrants. There will be a proposal for cross-border rail transport including the connection of five train stations to international high- speed lines (e.g.
"Hengelo, Venlo, Heerlen, Groningen and Zwolle)."
- Rural accessibility is improved by strengthening bus transportation between rural village centers.
"- In consultation with carriers and other authorities, measures are being taken to reduce the improve safety in public transport. Examples include deploying more boas on trains and buses who can and may actually act (e.g., by expanding identification capabilities for boas) and introducing bodycams for chief conductors; the latter only on a voluntary basis."
"- As far as aviation is concerned, the efforts in the coming years must focus on putting the legal protection of local residents (noise pollution) in order, while maintaining the network quality of Schiphol. This will make further growth with quieter and cleaner aircraft possible in the longer term."
"4. A good future for agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, for food security, for nature Pride, guts and hope and being able to earn a good living are at the heart of agriculture, horticulture, fisheries and nature policy. Our farmers, gardeners and fishermen should be cherished because they are important for our food supply and the Dutch cultural landscape, and are an inseparable part of our Dutch culture."
"In doing so, high-quality agricultural land protected. It does not steer for forced shrinkage of livestock, but for preservation of important wildlife."
- Future prospects and extra attention for young farmers so they can take over or start businesses.
"- In Europe, bold efforts are being made to adapt European directives so that they are workable and support the revenue model."
"Efforts are being made to: Page | 9 o A new, region-specific derogation from the Nitrates Directive (based on measured water quality as in other countries). o The derogation-free zones (transition zones) around Natura-2000 areas are restricted to nitrogen-sensitive natural areas only."
o Buffer strips will be reduced from 250 to 100 meters.
o The maximum amount of nitrogen from livestock manure of 170 kg/ha will be removed from the Nitrates Directive.
"o Realignment of Natura2000 areas, aiming for a main structure of robust natural areas (no ""snippet nature"")."
"- No new national headlines on European policy, existing headlines will be removed as much as possible."
- We do not want to import what we are not allowed to produce in the Netherlands.
"- When concluding international trade agreements, the level playing field is paramount."
- Laws and regulations are subjected to more stringent legal scrutiny on the front end to avoid lawsuits afterwards.
"Agriculture and horticulture - Farmers and gardeners have been working with the soil, animals, environment and nature for centuries."
They are the professionals. The expertise of the farmers and market gardeners is therefore central: we go from means to ends. The farmer is at the helm here.
"- To this end, company-specific emission targets for nature, water quality, climate and air pollution will be formulated wherever possible. A legally tenable 'balance of substances' will be developed as soon as possible so that farmers know where they stand, can manage their own targets and can achieve them in full. In order to speed things up, a start will be made with elements that can be implemented quickly, with area- and farm-specific goals if necessary."
"- The manure crisis is receiving urgent attention, lest there be a generic cut."
"- According to the Nitrates Directive, Member States are required at least every four years to review the designation of vulnerable areas reviewed. The Netherlands has designated the whole country as vulnerable, so this can be revised. The Netherlands will demonstrate in Brussels that certain areas are no longer vulnerable, this can be done immediately. Instead of designating all of the Netherlands as vulnerable, there will be a designation per area. This is important because the standard of 170 kilo nitrogen per hectare from livestock manure only applies in vulnerable areas."
This results immediately in more placement space for manure.
Nitrogen and phosphate standards in surface water are brought in line with our surrounding countries: Belgium and Germany. This will reduce the area of nutrient-polluted areas.
- Everything is being done to reverse the phasing out of the current derogation and to reach better and workable standards and agreements with the EU.
"In the meantime, we are considering what emergency measures are needed to solve the manure crisis."
- Cooperation between arable and livestock farmers is encouraged.
Differences in manure policy for grassland and cropland are eliminated where possible. For example: the spreading of solid manure on arable land with a standing crop such as winter wheat in the spring allow without incorporation requirement (that the manure does not have to be worked into the soil). Grassland does not have this incorporation requirement.
Equal policy would also allow more Page | 10 manure application space mean.
Page | 11 - No forced shrinkage of livestock will be directed and there will be no forced expropriation.
"- Innovation is understood broadly, that is, including feed and management. Innovation is given the space it deserves, procedures are adapted and innovation resources are designed so that new inventions can be quickly applied in a legally tenable way and goals are extracted. - There will be a separate innovation program for robotization aimed at saving labor."
"- Measures for a good living: o Agricultural nature management and ecosystem services are rewarded with long-term market-based financial security. o New revenue models are being developed and the food chain, including industry and banks, is contributing to the revenue model."
"o Red diesel is coming back for farmers, gardeners and contractors."
"- Where the use of models is unavoidable, they are based in part on measurement and knowledge, and on actual observations in practice."
The Aerius calculator model will be replaced for licensing purposes as soon as there is a legally tenable alternative.
We are working hard on this.
"- A new system for the assessment of low-emission stalls and stall systems, based as far as possible on company measurements, will be put in place as soon as possible, also for the purpose of licensing."
"- There are regular consultations with agricultural, horticultural and fisheries organizations, and policies are based on what works in practice."
"- Perspectives are offered, improving the earnings model and taking into account the ""Remkes staircase"" (innovate, extensify, relocate and quit). A generous voluntary and long-term cessation scheme takes place in a tax-friendly manner."
- Any buyouts will be targeted at aging farms with the least favorable climate and/or environmental and animal welfare conditions. Farmers who take advantage of the National Livestock Location Termination Scheme (LBV and LBV+) will have their demolition obligation postponed until the manure market is stable again.
"- The central government is taking charge of the licensing of manure processing. In cooperation with provinces and municipalities, the problems surrounding licensing resolved energetically."
"Animal worthiness - Concrete steps are being taken toward a future-proof, even more animal-worthy livestock industry. - To this end, it defines for each animal species what barns must meet in the long term. This will give livestock farmers a realistic timeframe for adapting livestock housing, in a natural amortization rhythm."
The government will make it possible to start concrete pilots.
"- When working out the details, attention will be paid to the investments this requires from livestock farmers and what part they can recoup through a good earnings model."
"If this cannot be done sufficiently, we will consider how the government can contribute to this or the policy will be adjusted."
"Page | 12 - Additionally, how to end the transport of animals over long distances is being considered, if this cannot be done according to the applicable, European animal welfare requirements, and cannot be enforced."
"Nature Restoration Policy - Dutch nature and our, created and maintained by farmers and gardeners, cultural landscape is beautiful. Where necessary, we work on conservation in an area-specific way. We strengthen our immediate environment and provide agriculturally inclusive nature. - In nature policy, the actually measured state of nature will be leading."
The critical deposit value will go out of law and be replaced by a legally tenable alternative.
- The national Flora and Fauna database will be opened for public purposes free of charge and without limitation as soon as possible.
"- The nitrogen approach will be based on company-specific emission targets, based on the area-based approach. - Nitrogen reduction takes place where it is demonstrably necessary for conservation, and other pressures are also addressed. Nitrogen reduction is needed so that nitrogen space is created and external offsetting becomes possible in every province."
"- There will be a legally tenable, scientifically sound mathematical lower limit, or threshold, of at least 1 mol/ha/year."
"On this basis, or with available nitrogen space through external offsetting, 'PAS reporters' will be legalized with priority. All this will be legally secured."
"Fisheries - We are proud of our Dutch fishermen, who have contributed to food security for centuries. We are going to make sure again that fishermen and the fishing industry around them can earn a good living. The survival of Dutch fisheries is crucial for the Netherlands. That is why the fisheries sector is given maximum support in getting a future-proof fleet. Fishermen are part of Dutch culture and every effort is made to fight for them."
Also in Brussels.
"Fishermen are supported in innovations, safety and the development of sustainable fishing techniques. - Every effort is being made in Europe by the Netherlands to allow pulse fishing again. - Better access to the North Sea and other fishing grounds with adequate space for fishing is coming soon. - Bottom fishers and shrimp fishers are struggling. Together with these groups of fishermen, we are actively seeking large areas that we will designate as ""fishing acres"" where bottom and shrimp fishermen will have priority."
"The Ministry of LNV will be called the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Nature (LVVN)."
"Page | 13 5. Energy transition, security of supply and climate adaptation For energy and security of supply, the Netherlands is now too dependent on unreliable countries. The energy transition should focus on reducing existing and preventing new dependence."
"It is crucial that this is not at the expense of people with small pockets and small businesses, such as the corner baker and handyman."
Part of the funds now available for the energy transition will be used specifically for these people.
In order to properly Being prepared for the future is firmly committed to climate adaptation.
"Stable policy is important: citizens and businesses need to know where they stand. The Climate policy must be bearable, feasible and practicable; action perspectives for citizens and businesses are crucial. We stick to the existing agreements; only if we do not meet the targets will we make alternative policies."
There will be no new national headlines on European policy.
"Energy Transition Efforts are being made to increase energy independence and own renewable energy production. With the right measures, green growth is promoted and harmful emissions are reduced."
"By investing in renewable energy sources and innovation, the Netherlands is creating a favorable climate for entrepreneurship. This leads not only to a cleaner environment, but also to economic growth and new business opportunities."
The following elements are targeted: - Climate funding is used in part to help low- and middle-income people and entrepreneurs in the energy transition. These include: o Helping people and small business owners make their homes and commercial properties more sustainable.
This ensures a lower energy bill. Specific attention is paid to people who face much higher energy bills as a result of being connected to a heat network.
"o There will be no mandatory label jumps for owner-occupied homes, and the requirement that from 2026, when replacing a boiler, a heat pump will be required install, is deleted."
"o The purchase of electric vehicles will continue to be supported, also keeping in mind the ""fossil drivers"" and a fair distribution of costs between the two groups."
"The subsidies all stop by 2025, the MRB weight correction (fiscal) remains in place."
"We are looking at ways to postpone the establishment of zero- emission zones, among other things to be able to regulate exceptions for entrepreneurs nationwide (standardization). The establishment of zero-emission zones will remain a municipal decision."
"- In addition, the Climate Fund is used for investments in innovations and technology such as ""CCS"" and green hydrogen. If necessary, blue hydrogen can be used as an intermediate step."
"Subsidizing bioenergy will be stopped as soon as possible combined with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) and biomass power plants, in accordance with the previously agreed phase-out path. - The announced increased carbon will be reversed."
"tax - The customization agreements are important to keep our industry competitive and profitable, therefore they will be continued. It is being considered whether the customization approach can be expanded for new or regional companies and technologies, for example, that can contribute to the transition."
"Page | 14 - The Borssele nuclear power plant will remain open; construction of two nuclear power plants will continue. There will also be two additional nuclear power plants, including the possibility of multiple small power plants. Proper spatial integration of the power plants is crucial, including for support. The government contributes to construction through public- private partnerships and knowledge development."
"- Resolving grid congestion will be prioritized, with direction from the Cabinet, including (re)prioritization of who is connected to the grid and when."
- Security of supply is being secured.
Long-term gas contracts will be concluded and reserves will be established for gas and critical raw materials. No more Groningen gas; gas production in the North Sea will be scaled up.
"Windmills will be located at sea as much as possible, instead of on land, with space for fisheries being considered first."
A careful balance will be sought here.
- No new national headlines on European regulations.
"Phase-out of fossil subsidies for energy supply will take place at the European level. - In resource transition, reducing dependence on other countries is central."
"Wherever possible, materials are reused."
"Adaptation/adapting to climate change The Netherlands must continue to adapt to climate change. - The adaptation approach is being updated to include at least: o the effects of desiccation on food production and foundation damage to buildings and infrastructure, among other things, and o freshwater availability (also in relation to salinization)."
"- Rivers are of great importance to the Netherlands, for freight transport by inland waterway, but also for freshwater availability, water storage, nature and recreation."
"The Room for the River program will be updated, rivers will remain navigable and receive more space. - The Flood Protection Program is being redesigned to ensure that our levees continue to provide adequate and timely protection in the future."

The debt remains below 60%.
"The European budgetary standards as set out in the Wet Houdbare Overheidsfinanciën (law on sustainable public finances) and the Stability and Growth Pact are being respected.

If there is a threat of exceeding (based on the Central Economic Plan of the Central Planning Bureau (CPB)) the 3% norm in the following year, additional measures will be taken, first of all looking at expenditure reduction is looked at."
"In accordance with the Hof Act, a trend-based fiscal policy is pursued, including separation of revenues and expenditures, a predetermined expenditure framework and revenue framework, and one main decision point in the spring that is maintained by the Minister of Finance.

Any decisions on this will be made annually in the spring.
"New expenditures must be redirected elsewhere within the national budget. Spending on military and humanitarian 1 In the case of a health care setback, the reverse applies and the setback does have to be accommodated within the expenditure framework. Page | 26 support to Ukraine and the domestic reception of refugees from Ukraine in the Netherlands are not covered by the expenditure framework. The reception costs of first-year asylum refugees will be allocated to the ODA budget up to a maximum of 10 percent from 2027. Otherwise, asylum spending becomes a general file."
"In addition, spending on Surveillance and Protection in the J&V budget will also become a general file. On the expense side, the policy-based expense development as currently foreseen is maintained; policy-based deviations from this must be compensated for. Non-policy-related developments in revenues run with the balance (i.e., automatic stabilization occurs). The financial policies and budgetary effects in the coalition program will be calculated by the CPB at the next estimation moment. The budget annex shows the effects of the outline agreement on public finances. Otherwise, parties adopt the basic budget path. For the budgetary treatment of the agreement, all amounts in the tables in the appendices are leading."
